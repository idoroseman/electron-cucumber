Cucumber for Electron
=====================
Cucumber for Electron allows Electron application developers to build
[Cucumber.js](https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber-js)-based feature
tests to test their applications. Cucumber has developed into a valuable
tool for building automated acceptance tests for many applications and
this package hopes to extend this success to Electron applications.
